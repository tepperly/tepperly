- 👋 Hi, I’m @tepperly. My work ranges from computer science, computational science/engineering, and amateur radio software.
- 👀 I’m interested in many things including azimuthal maps, amateur radio contest scoring, parallel computing, mathematical optimization, music, and in-person games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning optimization under uncertainty for PDE-constrained problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amateur radio contest scoring software.
- 📫 I prefer contact by email.
